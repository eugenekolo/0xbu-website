DEPRECATED. Website source is github.com/0xbu/0xbu.github.io now.

# 0xBU Ghost Blog Platform

## Deploy
Simple:
```
git clone https://github.com/eugenekolo/0xbu-website
cd 0xbu-website
./0xbu-website-go.sh
```

Note 1: You must have SSL certs, nginx config, and ghost config properly set up, and in place. They are not checked into this repo.  

## Changing
Most changes should just be in `content/themes/0xBU-theme`.

## TODO
- [ ] Figure out how to import kolobytelib, and other libs, and keep them updated.
requirements.txt?
- [ ] Add in scarlet-alert
- [ ] Add analytics
- [ ] Add a box or arrow around the current context title instead of having a giant header.
- [ ] Add in date posted for blog posts
- [ ] Add SSL renewal, and backup to 0xbu-website-go.sh
